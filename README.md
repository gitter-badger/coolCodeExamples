# Cool code examples
Home of simple to complex examples in different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

When I learn a new language, framework, or library, the examples their respective official site are often a good place to start but often fall short if I want to learn more. So I ended up with googling the web just to hunt down bits and pieces, and often it takes a long time.

This repository is created to solve that problem in mind.  If you have something you can share, feel free to fork it and create PRs.
